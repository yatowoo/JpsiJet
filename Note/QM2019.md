# Abstract - QM2019

The production of heavy quarkonia in hadron-hadron collisiions occurs at the transition between the preturbative and non-pertubative regimes of QCD, resulting in a rich phenomenology that remains far from being fully understood. $J/\psi$ hadronization dynamics can be studied by measuring the $p_{T}$ fraction, $z \equiv p_{T,J/\psi} / p_{T,jet}$, carried by the $J/\psi$ meson detected inside a jet. The shape of the fragmentation pattern gives us a opportunity to reveal the dominant subprocesses during $J/\psi$ production. In addition, the production of non-prompt $J/\psi$, coming from b hadron decays, inside a jet should be sensitive to the fragmentation functions of quarks and gluons into b hadrons.

The fragmentation function of $J/\psi$ in jets were recently measured in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13~TeV$ by LHCb Collaboration and at $\sqrt{s} = 5.02~TeV$ by CMS Collaboration. In these previous results, while the production of non-prompt $J/\psi$ in jets is well described by models, prompt $J/psi$ tend to be produced at much lower $z$ than predicted.

In this contribution, we report the measurements of the fragmentation of jets into $J/\psi$ in pp collision at $\sqrt{s} = 13~TeV$ at mid-rapidity ($|\eta|<0.9$). The result are compared with expectations from simulations and theoretical models. Both prompt and non-prompt components are presented.
