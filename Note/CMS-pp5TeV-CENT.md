## Results

The

## Datasets

Low pile-up pp data in 2015.

## Event selection

Dimuon channel for $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ pair in $0 < |y| < 1.6$ and $6.5 < p_{T} < 35.0~GeV/c$.

Muon selection:

* $p_{T} > 3.50~GeV/c$ for $|\eta|<1.2$
* $p_{T} > 1.89~GeV/c$ for $2.1<|\eta|<2.4$
* $D_{xy} < 0.3~cm$ and $D_{z} < 20~cm$
* Prob. of two tracks from a common vertex > 1%
* CMS dimuon trigger and soft criteria.
* $\Delta p_{T}/p_{T}$: 1~2%

## Jet finding

Anti-$k_{T}$ algorithm with R=0.4 from constituents created by CMS [particle-flow](https://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/publications/PRF-14-001/index.html) algorithm. $J/\psi$ candidates are input directly into the clustering, by replacing the daughter muons (using PDG mass).  [Jet calibration](https://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/publications/JME-13-004/index.html) was only applied to the component of the jet $p_{T}$ from particles other than the $J/\psi$ itself, i.e., jet $p_{T}\times(1-z)$.

* $25 < p_{T,jet} < 35~GeV/c$
* $|y_{jet}| < 2.4$
* $p_{T,jet}$ simulated is smeared by 10%
