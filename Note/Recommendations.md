Conventions for text:
 
It is suggested to follow this guidelines for editing a text. The PPR had been prepared using these guidelines.
It is very helpful to have a common use within the Collaboration.
 
Basic rules in short: 
in italics ($..$) symbols
in roman, NOT in italics: units, particle names, abbreviations, chemical symbols, the integrand 'd'
 
examples:
A proton p has a momentum $p$.
An electron e has an electric charge $e$.
 
Some examples often used.
 
$\sqrt(s_{\mathrm NN} = 2.76$ TeV 
 
transverse momentum: $p_{\mathrm T}$    index not in italics
 
d$N$/d$y$
 
pp collisons and Pb--Pb (long dash Tex--) collisions is mostly used.
 
in Tex one can use:
 
\newcommand{\pip}{$\pi^{+}$}
\newcommand{\pim}{$\pi^{-}$}
\newcommand{\kap}{K$^{+}$}
\newcommand{\kam}{K$^{-}$}
\newcommand{\pbar}{$\rm\overline{p}$}
\newcommand{\degree}{$^{\rm o}$}
\newcommand{\s}{$\sqrt{s}$}
\newcommand{\pt}{\ensuremath{p_{\rm t}}}
\newcommand{\dedx}{d$E$/d$x$}
\newcommand{\dndy}{d$N$/d$y$}
\newcommand{\dndydpt}{${\rm d}^2N/({\rm d}y {\rm d}p_{\rm t})$}
\newcommand{\pp}{pp}
 
It is also suggested to use the xx.bib option in tex.
You can get the references in this format from SPIRES avoiding typing errors
BibTex makes for you the sorting of the references
